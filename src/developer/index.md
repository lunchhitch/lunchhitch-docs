Tech Stack
----------

This section contains information on the different frameworks used by this project

### yarn

`yarn` serves as the javascript/typescript package manager for the project

### Typescript

The project is written mainly in typescript, augmenting javascript with type checking to improve the robustness of our code.

### NextJS

NextJS is a fullstack framework designed around React, allowing us to develop our project as a single server instead of a separate frontend and backend. It also comes with different integrated components, like `next/router`, saving us the hassle of installing other packages like `react-router`, and optional components, like `next-auth`, which provides authentication.

#### NextAuth

`next-auth` serves as our library for managing authentication, chosen for its integration with NextJS.

### Firebase

To avoid having to hash and store passwords ourselves and thus exposing potential security vulnerabilites, this project utilizes Firebase to manage user accounts

### MongoDB/Mongo Atlas

Our database of choice is MongoDB, hosted by MongoDB's [cloud](https://mongodb.com) services

#### Prisma

Prisma serves as an ORM for the project. Combined with typescript, it allows for rich type checking while making transactions with our database

Getting Started
---------------

### Installing Dependencies

Building the project requires NodeJS and yarn. Download NodeJS 16.15.x from [here](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v16.x/)

Installing yarn is then as simple as running `npm install yarn`, with the `-g` flag if you're installing it globally

### Building the Project

First, clone the repository from [github](https://github.com/leeyi45/lunchhitch)

Enter the project directory, then run `yarn install`. This should install all the packages that the project requires

The basic repository structure is as follows:

`.   ├── prisma // Prisma configuration   │ └── prisma.schema   ├── src   │ ├── common // Common and reused React components go here   │ ├── pages // NextJS will serve these as pages on the webserver   │ │ └── api // NextJS API based routes   │ │ └── auth   │ │ └── [...nextauth].ts // NextAuth configuration   │ └── styles // CSS and styles go here   ├── testing // Code used for testing   ├── .eslintrc.js // eslint configuration   └── .env // Configure environment variables   `

### Environment Variables

Before starting the project, the following environment variables need to be set:

*   DATABASE\_URL
*   DATABASE\_USERNAME
*   DATABASE\_PASSWORD
